- OS command injection

Application was fetching climate details of a particular location clicked on map using a 3rd party api. Here it was mentioned that OS command injection is present

**Point to note**
\- In request body while trying to edit after quoted string and adding space while writing commands like `ls /`, spaces were not getting typed in ~~pretty mode~~ but got typed in **raw mode**
\- When we use ; or | it does not work but when we use & for os injection then it works. We had to hit and try to reach to the conclusion that we have to replace present double quoted string with **& command &** for os command injection to work.
\- to run an sh file `./name_of_file.sh` and `bash /path_to_file` were not working. `sh /path_to_file` worked.

Business logic flaw
\- we had to make the quantity of a product negative to make the price of a product negative and add other products to make price in our wallet >0 but <wallet_balance to buy a product of a price more than the ammount present in our wallet.
