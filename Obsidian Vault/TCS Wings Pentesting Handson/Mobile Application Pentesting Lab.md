-  finding and extracting apk file from an android emulator of an already installed applicationin that emulator

	commands
		- `adb shell pm list packages | grep -i "keyword_for_package_name"` 
		eg - package : com.example.someapp
		- `adb shell pm path com.example.someapp`
		eg output - package : /data/app/com.example.someapp-XXX\==/base.apk
		- `adb pull /data/app/com.example.someapp-XXX\==/base.apk .`
		or 
		`adb pull /data/app/com.example.someapp-XXX\==/base.apk /path/to/destination/folder`
		here . at the end in the first command indicates current directory on our local machine. So in this way we donot need to download an apk extractor app from playstore in the emulator for generating an apk file for the application we want to analyse in jadx-gui in our local machine. Sometimes playstore is not resent in the emulator and there are no means to download it either, at that time this method is useful.
