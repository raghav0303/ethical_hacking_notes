-  finding and extracting apk file from an android emulator of an already installed applicationin that emulator

	commands
		- `adb shell pm list packages | grep -i "keyword_for_package_name"` 
		eg - package : com.example.someapp
		- `adb shell pm path com.example.someapp`
		eg output - package : /data/app/com.example.someapp-XXX\==/base.apk
		- `adb pull /data/app/com.example.someapp-XXX\==/base.apk .`
		or 
		`adb pull /data/app/com.example.someapp-XXX\==/base.apk /path/to/destination/folder`
		here . at the end in the first command indicates current directory on our local machine. So in this way we donot need to download an apk extractor app from playstore in the emulator for generating an apk file for the application we want to analyse in jadx-gui in our local machine. Sometimes playstore is not resent in the emulator and there are no means to download it either, at that time this method is useful.

	- Steps
		- we understand the application process by analyzing the apk in jad-x gui. apk is given in files.
		- we find the ClaimViewActivity function and find the code that mathes the redeem coupon code. we go to the function name which returns the correct coupon code.
		- right click on function name and select 'copy as frida snnipet option'.
		- now paste the code in Vulnerability.js file and set the returned value to desired value.
		- open terminal and start frida server
			- commands
				- command to start frida server given in documents of handson lab
					- adb shell
					- su
					- 
				- frida-ps -Ua        // for displaying all the runningapps. com.something .something will be our app's id whom we are hacking
				- to hook the frida script in the app
					- frida -U -f com.something.something -l Vulnerability.js
		- now in the app, in the redeem coupon code input, write the value that we are returning in the the function we copied as frida snnipet. and enter.
		- so now we got the flag.
